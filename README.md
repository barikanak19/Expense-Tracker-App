## 🧩 Component Overview

### `App.jsx`
The root component. Manages global `expenses` state, reads/writes to `localStorage`, computes the total in INR, and passes data to child components via props.

### `Header.jsx`
Displays the app name and tagline at the top of the page.

### `ExpenseForm.jsx`
Controlled form with three fields (name, amount, category). Validates inputs before calling `onAddExpense`. Shows a shake animation on failed validation.

### `ExpenseList.jsx`
Renders all expenses as animated cards with colored category indicators. Shows an empty state illustration when no expenses exist.

### `SummaryPanel.jsx`
Computes and displays the total expenses and a per-category percentage breakdown with animated progress bars.

### `CurrencyConverter.jsx`
Fetches live exchange rates from the Frankfurter API using `useEffect`. Converts the total INR amount to the selected currency in real-time. Handles loading and error states gracefully.

### `Footer.jsx`
Simple footer with attribution and copyright.
